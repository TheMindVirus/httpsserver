Formerly known in separate parts as Embedded Systems, Web Development and Game Design

[EdgeServer]
Hardware and Software designed specifically to work together to bring
the high-end gaming experience to users of the World-Wide-Web

[EdgeSession]
HTTP TCP Connection and Interface between the player and the EdgeServer
that can be joined by receiving an EdgeSignal and left after a timeout of inactivity

[EdgeSignal]
HTTP TCP Advertisement for the EdgeSession so it can be listed as URL entries on
the landing page of a website served by the EdgeServer to the local network

[EdgeState]
JSON encoded edge-application-specific data that describes the state of the game
for the current player as 1 item and for all the players in an EdgeSession as many items

[Notes]
* Port Forwarding may be required to host LAN games on the Internet or on a WAN
* Choice of server language has historically been PHP, is now cross-platform Python
* Choice of client language has historically been Javascript, could also be Python
* HTTP GET requests in ASCII should be the baseline for communication
* Bonjour and mDNS services cannot be used due to the following reasons:
 - TCP is incompatible with UDP despite both being Internet Protocol (IP)
 - It is unreasonable to require all users to have exactly the same hardware
 - Only Ports above 10000 are allowed, most are blocked by Firewalls
 - AJAX and EventSource are recommended HTTP API's. Fetch and Beacon are not recommended.
 - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS/XORS) blocks same-origin requests without config
 - Unknown HTTP Headers can only be processed if the EdgeRunner has specified it
